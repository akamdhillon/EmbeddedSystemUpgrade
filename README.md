RC Car Control System Upgrade

- Took apart plastic car pieces to reach electrical components
- Removed microcontroller but left motors, differential-type component, and wheels.
- Ordered new rechargeable 1.2V AA batteries and used electrical tape with metal to create a 7.2V battery.
- Programmed 4 Relay Module to send high power to motors.
- Programmed HM-10 bluetooth module to recieve commands from Dabble APP
- Used phone accelerometer and gamepad buttons to wireless control RC car from IPhone.

Next steps:
- Integrate object detection through camera streaming to a web server.
- Upgrade bluetooth module to wi-fi module.
- Utilize OpenCV Library for object detection
